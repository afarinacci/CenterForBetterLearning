To understand why we need to investigate how our brains process spoken and written language. Spoken language is naturally picked up by using various language centers in the brain. The human brain was not designed to decode written language. This means we are using parts of our brain that were designed to perform entirely different tasks. One of the areas of the brain responsible for reading is the visual cortex. This part of the brain was designed for us to recognize things like objects and faces. For example, here are various pictures of chairs.\n\nDespite each one of them looking quite different, we recognize each one of the being a chair. We can group them all together and identify them under one category name because they share specific qualities. In this case, they all have a place to rest your bottom and your back. A child can use their sense of object constancy to accurately identify a rocking chair as a chair even if they have never seen one before. Now let us look at this concept in a different way:\n\nEven though the we are looking at the object from a different vantage point, we can still identify this object as a chair. The visual cortex gives us a sense of visual form constancy so we can still identify the object as a chair even if it is flipped upside down or backwards. The visual cortex is wired to be able to identify an object no what changes it may have in its orientation or size in space.\n\nNow here is where things get complicated. The rules of form constancy do not apply when learning the letters and learning how to read. For example, a child is presented with the letter “b”. Later the same child is presented with the letter “d”. To a child who has mastered form constancy, will looked at both of those letters and think they are the same. We now\n\nmust explain to the child that rules that have applies to every other object in the past no longer apply with letters. The process of reading requires an overruling of the previously understood concept of object form constancy.\n\nTo even a smart child, each one of these letters are a bubble with a stick attached to it. Every child goes through the same process of rewiring an already understood concept of form constancy to understand that each one these letters are separate objects. This process takes time for the child’s brain to rewire itself to embed the new concepts. Letter reversals should decrease as the child gains reading experience but can be expected until seven. If letter reversals are persisting past age seven, there is may be an underlying visual processing problem.\n\nFor more information on this topic:\n"},{"id":1593086400,"title":"Welcome to CenterForBetterLearning.com","author":"Andrea Farinacci","date":"June 25, 2020","time":"07:00","thumbnail":"/images/logo512.png","content":"\nCheck out our new blog on CenterForBetterLearning.com\n\n_Come back to read our weekly blog posts._\n"}]
