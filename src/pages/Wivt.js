      <p>
        Over 80% of the brain function is incorporated in the visual system. The
        highly functioning visual system is comprised of the eyes, brain, and
        body working effortlessly in coordination with one another. We begin
        building this complex system from the moment we start interacting with
        our environment. For some people, this happens in a step-by-step
        process, with each skill building upon the previous. For others, this
        system may be built on disorder, causing certain skills to be
        inefficient or ineffective. This disorder results in a patient that is
        struggling or taking longer than necessary to complete daily tasks. To
        improve the visual system, we need to embed, not just learn, new ways of
        taking in and processing visual information. We need to retrain the
        brain, and we do this by completing a vision therapy program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vision therapy is an individualized program of neurosensory and
        neuromuscular activities prescribed by a developmental optometrist to
        develop, rehabilitate and enhance visual skills and processing. After
        completing your annual comprehensive eye exam to make sure your eyes are
        healthy, we will perform additional testing to determine the
        functionality of the visual system. These additional tests will tell us
        how your eyes move, focus, work together, and how well you process
        visual information. We take into account the results of these additional
        tests, your signs and symptoms, and your visual needs to build a custom
        vision therapy program for you. A series of activities are presented to
        the patient under very controlled circumstances, practiced for
        reinforcement, and then built upon for enhancement of visual skills. The
        goal is not to strengthen eye muscles! Your eye muscles are already
        incredibly strong. Rather, the goal is to get the visual system
        functioning at optimal levels so as to improve one's quality of life.
        The length of the program depends on your goals, severity of the
        diagnosed conditions, and your dedication to home practice. Once the
        program is completed and the new brain connections have been made, your
        visual system will continue to grow and develop.

        Our programs are designed based on exhaustive scientific research and
        years of continuing education and clinical experience. We know that
        vision therapy requires a serious commitment from you and your family,
        and we don't take that commitment lightly. We are here to guide you
        every step of the way, from the initial phone call through the
        graduation of the program. We want to truly change your life{' '}
        <em>forever</em>.

        Our goals for bringing organization to an incredibly complex system are
        simple:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Help you develop or improve fundamental visual skills and abilities
        </li>
        <li>Improve visual comfort, ease, and efficiency</li>
        <li>Change the way you process or interpret visual information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Research has demonstrated vision therapy can be an effective treatment
        option for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ocular motility dysfunctions (eye movement disorders)</li>
        <li>Non-strabismic binocular disorders (inefficient eye teaming)</li>
        <li>Strabismus (misalignment of the eyes)</li>
        <li>Amblyopia (poorly developed vision)</li>
        <li>Accommodative disorders (focusing problems)</li>
        <li>
          Visual information processing disorders, including visual-motor
          integration and integration with other sensory modalities
        </li>
        <li>Visual sequelae of acquired brain injury</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We find most people who have come to this website for the same reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>

          You are worried about your or your loved one's future to navigate
          successfully through life
        </li>
        <li>
          The advice of others or other therapies you have tried have not paid
          off to eliminate your struggles.
        </li>
      </ol>

        If you are unsure if vision therapy is the right choice for you or your
        child. Please contact us at your earliest convenience. Our friendly and
        knowledgeable staff at Center for Better Learning will be glad to guide
        you through the process of determining if an undiagnosed visual problem
        is the source of your struggle.
